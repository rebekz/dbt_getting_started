# Realistic Data Pipeline: E-commerce Analytics with dbt

## Business Context

You work for **ShopSmart**, a growing e-commerce company that sells electronics, clothing, and home goods. The business stakeholders need insights into:

- **Revenue Analytics**: Daily/weekly/monthly revenue trends
- **Customer Analytics**: Customer lifetime value, retention, segmentation
- **Product Analytics**: Best-selling products, inventory turnover, pricing optimization
- **Marketing Analytics**: Campaign effectiveness, conversion rates

## Raw Data Sources

For this tutorial, we'll use CSV files that simulate real e-commerce data. This makes it easy to follow along without setting up a database!

### CSV Data Files (seeds/)
- `raw_users.csv` - Customer registration data
- `raw_orders.csv` - Order transactions
- `raw_order_items.csv` - Individual items within orders
- `raw_products.csv` - Product catalog
- `raw_categories.csv` - Product categories

**Benefits of using CSV files:**
- âœ… **Instant setup**: No database required
- âœ… **Version controlled**: Data changes tracked in Git
- âœ… **Portable**: Share datasets easily with team
- âœ… **Perfect for learning**: Focus on dbt concepts, not infrastructure

## Project Setup

Let's build this pipeline step by step:

### 1. Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dbt with DuckDB
pip install dbt-core dbt-duckdb

# Verify installation
dbt --version
```

### 2. Initialize the dbt Project

```bash
dbt init shopmart_analytics
cd shopmart_analytics
```

### 3. Configure DuckDB Connection

`profiles.yml`:
```yaml
shopmart_analytics:
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: duckdb
      path: 'shopmart.duckdb'
      threads: 4
    prod:
      type: duckdb
      path: 'shopmart_prod.duckdb'
      threads: 8
  target: dev
```

**Why DuckDB?**
- ðŸš€ **Fast**: Columnar storage, vectorized execution
- ðŸ’¾ **Lightweight**: Single file database
- ðŸ”§ **Zero maintenance**: No server to manage
- ðŸ“Š **Analytics optimized**: Built for analytical queries

### 4. Project Configuration

`dbt_project.yml`:
```yaml
name: 'shopmart_analytics'
version: '1.0.0'
config-version: 2

profile: 'shopmart_analytics'

### Layer 5: Analytics Marts

`models/marts/marketing/marketing_performance.sql`:
```sql
WITH orders AS (
    SELECT * FROM {{ ref('fct_orders') }}

daily_metrics AS (
    SELECT
        order_date,
        order_day_of_week,

## Advanced Features

### 1. Macros for Reusable Logic

`macros/get_customer_segment.sql`:
```sql
{% macro get_customer_segment(lifetime_value_column, order_count_column) %}
    CASE 
        WHEN {{ lifetime_value_column }} >= {{ var('high_value_customer_threshold') }} THEN 'High Value'
        WHEN {{ order_count_column }} >= 5 THEN 'Frequent'
        WHEN {{ order_count_column }} = 1 THEN 'One-time'
        ELSE 'Regular'
    END
{% endmacro %}
```

### 2. Custom Tests

`tests/assert_order_total_equals_sum_of_items.sql`:
```sql
WITH order_totals AS (
    SELECT
        o.order_id,
        o.order_total,
        SUM(oi.line_total) as calculated_total,
        ABS(o.order_total - SUM(oi.line_total)) as difference
    FROM {{ ref('stg_ecommerce__orders') }} o
    JOIN {{ ref('stg_ecommerce__order_items') }} oi 
        ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
    GROUP BY 1, 2
)

SELECT *
FROM order_totals
WHERE difference > 0.01  -- Allow for rounding differences
```

### 3. Snapshots for Historical Tracking

`snapshots/customers_snapshot.sql`:
```sql
{% snapshot customers_snapshot %}
    {{
        config(
          target_schema='snapshots',
          unique_key='user_id',
          strategy='timestamp',
          updated_at='updated_at'
        )
    }}

    SELECT * FROM {{ source('ecommerce_db', 'users') }}
    
{% endsnapshot %}
```

### 4. Seeds for Static Data

`seeds/product_categories_mapping.csv`:
```csv
category_id,category_name,category_group,is_seasonal
1,Electronics,Technology,FALSE
2,Clothing,Fashion,TRUE
3,Home & Garden,Home,FALSE
4,Sports,Lifestyle,TRUE
```

# Run in production
dbt run --target prod

# Run specific marts
dbt run --models marts.core --target prod

# Run with full refresh
dbt run --full-refresh --models fct_orders --target prod
```

### 2. CI/CD with dbt Cloud
```yaml
# .github/workflows/dbt.yml
name: dbt CI
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup dbt
        uses: dbt-labs/setup-dbt@v1
        with:
          dbt-version: 1.5.0
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: dbt deps
      - name: Run tests
        run: dbt test
```

## Quick Start: Running the Complete Pipeline

Follow these steps to run the entire pipeline:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your project
cd shopmart_analytics

# 2. Load all CSV data into DuckDB
dbt seed

# 3. Run all models (staging â†’ intermediate â†’ marts)
dbt run

# 4. Test data quality
dbt test

# 5. Generate documentation
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve  # Opens in browser at http://localhost:8080

# 6. View sample results
dbt show --select dim_customers --limit 5
dbt show --select marketing_performance --limit 10
```

### Sample Queries You Can Run

After running the pipeline, try these queries in your DuckDB database:

```sql
-- Top 5 customers by lifetime value
SELECT full_name, lifetime_value, total_orders, customer_segment
FROM dim_customers 
ORDER BY lifetime_value DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- Daily revenue trends
SELECT order_date, total_revenue, total_orders, avg_order_value
FROM marketing_performance 
ORDER BY order_date DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Product profitability analysis
SELECT product_name, brand, total_revenue, line_profit, profit_margin_pct
FROM fct_order_items 
WHERE line_profit IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY line_profit DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## Business Value and Key Metrics

This pipeline enables analysis of:

### Revenue Analytics
- Daily, weekly, monthly revenue trends
- Revenue by customer segment, product category
- Impact of discounts and promotions on profitability

### Customer Analytics
- Customer lifetime value distribution
- Customer retention and churn analysis
- Customer acquisition cost and payback period

### Product Analytics
- Best-selling products and categories
- Profit margin analysis by product
- Inventory turnover rates

### Marketing Analytics
- Campaign effectiveness and ROI
- Channel attribution analysis
- Customer acquisition funnel metrics

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Data Quality Monitoring**: Implement alerting for test failures
2. **Performance Optimization**: Add indexes, partitioning for large tables
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Add cohort analysis, predictive models
4. **Real-time Streaming**: Integrate with Kafka/streaming for real-time metrics
5. **Data Governance**: Implement column-level lineage and PII handling

This comprehensive example demonstrates how dbt enables modern data teams to build scalable, tested, and documented analytics pipelines that directly support business decision-making.
